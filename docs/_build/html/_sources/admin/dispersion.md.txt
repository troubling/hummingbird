## Dispersion Report

As noted at the top of this document, andrewd will populate and monitor dispersion objects to ensure data is reachable at all times. The recon tool can show you the last dispersion report andrewd created, when run on the same server as andrewd runs.

Note that the JSON output will give specific detail on which partitions are missing replicas to help with any investigation.
